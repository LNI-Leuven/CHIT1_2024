# CHIT1 AT DIAGNOSIS IN MS - CODE
This public repository contains the R code scripts to reproduce the main results and figures from our article **CHIT1 at diagnosis predicts faster disability progression and reflects early microglial activation in multiple sclerosis** published in *Science Translational Medicine* (BeliÃ«n et al.; 2023). In this study we provided a clear rationale for further validation of CHIT1 as a prognostic biomarker in multiple sclerosis (MS). To do so, we applied mixed-effects models, a machine learning approach and single-cell/nucleus transcriptomics. The R code for these analyses is here available and structured as follows:

**Statistical models**
- Correlation analysis:
- Single-time point analysis:
- Multi-time point analysis:

**Machine learning**
- `code.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook (Python) showcasing the calculation of permutation importances for this paper.
- `code_utils.py` introduces some utility functions that are used in `code.ipynb`.
- `matplotlibrc` contains the plot generation setup.
- `requirements.txt` lists required Python packages to run the code yourself.

**Single-cell/nucleus transcriptomics**
