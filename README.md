# CHIT1 AT DIAGNOSIS IN MS - CODE
This public repository contains the R code scripts to reproduce the main results and figures from our article **CHIT1 at diagnosis reflects early microglial activation and predicts future disability progression in MS** published in *Science Translational Medicine* (BeliÃ«n et al.; 2023). In this study we provided a clear rationale for further validation of CHIT1 as a prognostic biomarker in multiple sclerosis (MS). To do so, we applied mixed-effects models, a machine learning approach and single-cell/nucleus transcriptomics. The R code for these analyses is here available and structured as follows:

**Statistical models**
- Correlation analysis:
- Single-time point analysis:
- Multi-time point analysis:

**Machine learning**
- Machine learning:

**Single-cell/nucleus transcriptomics**
- Quality control: 1. Quality_Control_CSF.RMD and 2. Quality_Control_CNS.RMD
- Integration: 3. Integration_With_Harmony.RMD
- Myeloid subclustering: 4. Myeloid_Subclustering.RMD
- Cluster annotation: 5. Cluster_Annotation.RMD
- Trajectory analysis: 6. Trajectory_Analysis.RMD
- Distribution and DGE CHIT1+ cells: 7. Distribution_And_DGE_CHIT1_Cells.RMD
- Pathway analysis: 8. Pathway_Analysis.RMD
